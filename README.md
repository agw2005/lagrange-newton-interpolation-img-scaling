This repository contains a Python implementation for image upscaling using Lagrange and Newton interpolation methods. It compares their performance against standard bilinear interpolation and evaluates results both visually and quantitatively using MSE and PSNR metrics.

You can access the interpolation utility using this [https://newton-lagrange-image-upscaler.streamlit.app/](link) which will take you to a Streamlit application.
